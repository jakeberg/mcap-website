            <br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">MCAP is year-round program.  Activities are conducted throughout the school year and over the summer months.  Typically, the activity begins in the fall of each calendar year.  The components of this (12) month cycle are as follows:
                <ul>
                    <li>September - December ( recruitment, curriculum design)</li>
                    <li>January - March (high school lectures and student recruitment applications)</li>
                    <li>April - May (planning and program preparation)</li>
                    <li>June - August (summer internship training, lectures, college field trips)</li>

            <br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">MCAP Foundation has five integrated and inter-dependent components that are essential to the success of each
                MCAP participant. These are
                <i>Instruction, Internship, Mentoring, Continued Education, and Community Service.</i>

                <strong>
                    <u>Hands-on-Training.</u>
                </strong>This hands-on training approach, although typical for industry, is generally not available in high school
                environments. Our focus is to develop real-life scenario skills that participants will use in job situations.
                Each student works in a real broadcast studio performing tasks they will perform in job settings upon completion
                of the program (either in college or the workplace).
                <br> MCAP professional instructors teach in-depth techniques and procedures for audio and video, including working
                with state-of-the-art digital broadcast television equipment. Students work with next generation non-linear
                production suites and receive extensive training with cameras, switchers, video and audio editors, digital
                video effects equipment, computer graphics, virtual sets, 3D effects, chroma-key, time base correctors, reading
                wave form and vector scopes, lighting and teleprompters, TV and radio operations and engineering, production
                techniques and technical troubleshooting.

                <strong>
                    <u>Technical Instructors.</u>
                </strong> MCAP has some of the most talented professional video and sound instructors from throughout Indiana’s major
                stations and production facilities in central Indiana. Many are Emmy and other industry award winning professionals
                with decades of technical and managerial experience in national and local settings. Key state-of-the-art
                technical classes include, but are not limited to: Broadcast Television and Radio Systems, Digital Video
                Editing, Video Production, Web-Site Development, Voice &amp; Data Telecommunications, Computer Graphics,
                Executive Production, Studio/Field Cameras, Broadcast Operations, Publications &amp; E-Publications, Computer
                Engineering, and Production Graphic Design.

                <strong>
                    <u>Skills Training.</u>
                </strong> Technical skill training is a given. However, life skill training is also necessary in order to compete and
                have a successful career. This training is generally not offered in high schools, colleges, and universities.
                This includes, self-esteem building, effective communication, problem solving, conflict resolution, relationship
                building, resume design, and interviewing.

            <h2><strong>How does the MCAP Internship component work?</strong>
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">
                MCAP creates summer jobs (paid internships) for its youth and young adults participants. The MCAP program activities prepare
                participants to overcome many of the obstacles encountered when seeking suitable employment. MCAP’s program
                experiences allow students to become more competitive in the market for summer and full time opportunities.
                Much of the instruction will prepare them with skill levels comparable with college students who have taken
                coursework specific to their major.
                <br>
                <br> Unlike traditional intern programs, MCAP students work for partner companies during summers and school breaks
                from the summer following sophomore year through the summer after graduation. During the internship program,
                students have an opportunity to learn many aspects of corporate operations and develop company-specific skills.
                Corporations have an opportunity to train and mentor students with the option of fulltime employment.
                <br>
                <br> Once selected for an internship by corporate sponsors, MCAP proactively monitors the progress and training
                details of the students. MCAP monitors each student’s progress, attendance skills and work performance throughout
                their internship. MCAP staff acts in an advisory capacity for both interns and sponsoring companies, especially
                if questions or problems arise.

            <br><br>
            <h2><strong>How does the MCAP Mentoring component work?</strong> </h2>
            <br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">
                Mentoring is an important component that augments both the instruction and internship provided to each student. One of the
                key variables to a successful career is a support team to help guide each student’s development. Due to their
                age and high learning curve, MCAP matches students with media professionals currently employed in the industry.
                <br>
                <br> Each student is assigned both a mentor at their place(s) of internship as well as other broadcast experts
                who volunteer to help with the mentoring process. Mentoring plans are developed for each MCAP student.

            <h2><strong>How does the MCAP Continuing Education component work?</strong>
            </h2>
            <br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">

                MCAP provides continuing education class modules for the students through direct instruction, webinars, online classes, and
                workshops. MCAP staff tracks and monitors students' skills and work performance throughout the program and
                tracks graduates' career progress. The MCAP staff will collaborate to develop and implement detailed career
                development plans that outline the steps for the student’s success in the broadcasting and media industry.
                <br>
                <br> MCAP offers students a lifetime experience. MCAP tracks each program participant well after high school
                graduation. MCAP continuously monitors students' skills and work performance throughout the program and tracks
                graduates' career progress. MCAP staff continues to work with students to develop and implement detailed
                career development plans that outline the steps for their success in the broadcasting and media industry.

            <h2><strong>How are students recruited and selected to participate in MCAP?</strong>
            </h2><br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">

                Selection of participants is a tedious and competitive process. MCAP endeavors to recruit and select from a diverse pool
                of students. Special considerations for students from underserved and/or underrepresented communities may
                also be made.
                <br>
                <br> MCAP works with the directors of many school systems’ technology centers and programs to identify and recruit
                students who meet our criteria for participation. Referrals and recommendations are obtained from teachers,
                counselors and administrators. Completion of an essay is required. An interview and parental permission are
                mandatory.
                <br>
                <br> MCAP evaluates a number of key characteristics and abilities for each student, including:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Math and science aptitude</li>
                    <li>Grade Point Average</li>
                    <li>Career aspirations</li>
                    <li>Communications and writing skills</li>
                    <li>Life skills</li>
                    <li>Math and science aptitude</li>
                    <li>Leadership skills, and ability to work within team environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <br><br>
            <h2><strong>How does MCAP measure success?</strong></h2>
            <br><br>
            <div class="lead text-white">
                Each major component of MCAP has specific criteria for evaluating success, including grades in courses, mentor and sponsor
                feedback, equipment operation skill demonstrations, and community service related performance. Moreover,
                upon completion of the program, our graduates must have developed skills that are commensurate with current
                professional practices and standards, thus making them truly competitive and a desired hire.
                <br>
                <br> Our program tracks the number of created opportunities for a multitude of young people who had not been
                able to gain access to employment. MCAP students are evaluated for their demonstrated ability to work in
                a professional environment under supervision, to successfully interact with other employees in a team environment,
                and to contribute to the overall mission of the sponsoring organization. MCAP also measures its success by
                evaluating the effectiveness by which it develops and builds specific skills and capabilities prior to students
                selecting and entering a college career path.
