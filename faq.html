            <h2><strong>What is the MCAP Foundation?</strong></h2>
            <br><br>
            <p class="lead text-white">The MCAP Foundation is the Media Career Advancement Program (“MCAP”). Based in Indianapolis, Indiana, the MCAP Foundation is a federal tax exempt, 501(c)(3) non-profit organization developed and founded to prepare youth for media careers. MCAP is a catalyst for youth and young adults to attain career opportunities in the media, broadcast, and production industry.
                <br><br>
                <h2><strong>What is the MCAP vision?</strong></h2>
                <br><br>
                <p class="lead text-white">The MCAP Foundation works to create and institutionalize infrastructure for high school and other youth to attain meaningful employment and career opportunities within the sophisticated, technical growth media and broadcast industry. MCAP visualizes a time when our youth, including underserved and disadvantaged youth, have access to the state-of-the-art training and experience required to be successful in this competitive marketplace.
                    <br><br>
                    <h2><strong>What is the MCAP mission?</strong></h2>
                    <br><br>
                    <p class="lead text-white">The mission of the MCAP Foundation is to identify, recruit, motivate, instruct, mentor, counsel, prepare, and facilitate youth and young adults to gain employment, post secondary education, and/or professional careers in broadcasting and media. MCAP creates a platform to connect educational institutions and community organizations with media partners at the forefront of the industry (professionals, associations, and corporate partners).
                        <br><br>
                        <h2><strong>Why was MCAP founded?</strong></h2>
                        <br><br>
                        <p class="lead text-white">MCAP was established to fill the identified need for effective career training, internships and mentoring of youth for employment and careers in the media, broadcast and production industry. By providing guidance, training and exposure to the work force capabilities that are required and sought by industry leaders and businesses, MCAP can help solve this major problem.
                            <br><br>
                            <h2><strong>Why do we need an MCAP Foundation?</strong></h2>
                            <br><br>
                            <p class="lead text-white">There is a tremendous need to provide educational opportunities for youth, young adults, and underserved youth to attain career opportunities in the media, broadcast, and production industry, an industry that offers lucrative and fulfilling employment, but historically has not been accessible to diverse populations.
                                <br><br>
                                <h2><strong>What is the MCAP approach?</strong></h2>
                                <br><br>
                                <p class="lead text-white">MCAP provides a platform for school systems and media professions to connect and work together to prepare youth for media careers. Through strategic alliances MCAP is an effective, cost efficient vehicle advancing the purposes of the youth, their families, communities, and school systems as well as the media industry.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h2><strong>When are MCAP activities conducted?</strong></h2>
                                    <br><br>
                                    <p class="lead text-white">MCAP is year-round program.  Activities are conducted throughout the school year and over the summer months.  Typically, the activity begins in the fall of each calendar year.
                                        <br><br>
                                        <h2><strong>What are the key components of MCAP?</strong></h2><br><br>
                                        <p class="lead text-white">MCAP Foundation has five integrated and inter-dependent components that are essential to the success of each MCAP participant. These are Instruction, Internship, Mentoring, Continued Education, and Community Service.
                                            <br><br>


                                            <h2><strong>How does the MCAP Internship component work?</strong></h2>
                                            <br><br>
                                            <p class="lead text-white">MCAP creates summer jobs (paid internships) for its youth and young adults participants. The MCAP program activities prepare participants to overcome many of the obstacles encountered when seeking suitable employment. MCAP’s program experiences allow students to become more competitive in the market for summer and full time opportunities. Much of the instruction will prepare them with skill levels comparable with college students who have taken coursework specific to their major.
                                                <br><br>
                                                <h2><strong>How does the MCAP Mentoring component work?</strong></h2>
                                                <br><br>
                                                <p class="lead text-white">Mentoring is an important component that augments both the instruction and internship provided to each student. One of the key variables to a successful career is a support team to help guide each student’s development. Due to their age and high learning curve, MCAP matches students with media professionals currently employed in the industry.
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    <h2><strong>How are students recruited and selected to participate in MCAP?</strong></h2>
                                                    <br><br>
                                                    <p class="lead text-white">Selection of participants is a tedious and competitive process. MCAP endeavors to recruit and select from a diverse pool of students. Special considerations for students from underserved and/or underrepresented communities may also be made.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        <p class="lead text-white">MCAP works with the directors of many school systems’ technology centers and programs to identify and recruit students who meet our criteria for participation. Referrals and recommendations are obtained from teachers, counselors and administrators. Completion of an essay is required. An interview and parental permission are mandatory.
